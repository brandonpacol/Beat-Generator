# Beat Generator
Concept for a random beat generator website. Randomly combine midi files to create a beat!

## Introduction
For music creators, sometimes we already have chord progression and melody in our head and just need a quick beat to lay our composition over. A random beat generator would be the ideal solution!

## Technologies
- HTML
- Javascript
- Bootstrap 5
- Tone.js
- Tone.js/midi

## Launch
1. Open https://brandonpacol.github.io/Beat-Generator/
2. Select your kick, snare, and hat sound.
3. Press "Generate Beat".
4. Press "Play".
5. Enjoy the beat!
5. To download the current midi file for a drum, press the respective midi button.

## Functionality to add
- Play one midi file instead of three separate midi files (right now, there is a lag).
- Keep a midi file for a drum but randomize the others.
- Play/Pause 
- Mute and Solo drums
